While modern encryption helps keep ali and taher’s message safe from tarek, tarek can still figure out some things just by knowing they’re talking and how often.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To keep their conversation totally secret, ali and taher got clever. They know that tons of pictures are shared online every day. So instead of talking directly, ali can hide his message inside a picture in a spot they both know about. Then taher can find it without tarek knowing they’re talking at all.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[The source of creativity and the balance between copying and stealing]]></title><description><![CDATA[the famous quote 'Good artists copy.

&lt;p&gt;At the heart of this quote lies a difference between copying and stealing in the creative process. Copying involves borrowing an idea for its known useage, while stealing involves taking an idea and transforming it into something else.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[The source of creativity and the balance between copying and stealing]]></title><description><![CDATA[the famous quote 'Good artists copy.
