The famous quote "Good artists copy. Great artists steal" makes us focus on a fundamental truth: innovation often involves building upon existing ideas rather than starting from scratch. It cancels the idealized notion of creativity and encourages us to embrace the reality that creativity is often a collaborative process.

At the heart of this quote lies a difference between copying and stealing in the creative process. Copying involves borrowing an idea for its known useage, while stealing involves taking an idea and transforming it into something else.

It's important to recognize that copying is not a bad thing; in fact, it's essential. However, as we move towards stealing, more skill and creativity are required. So, when should we copy, and when should we steal?

In my previous experience, i would often look for copying features from similar products when i'am going to work in a new product. While this approach initially raised concerns about the credits and honesty, but in other hand it actually had advantages.

Copying provides a foundation upon which to build and innovate. Just as you wouldn't start making a car with inventing the wheel alone, you shouldn't overlook the importance of a solid base. Copying functional elements allows you to focus your creative energy on areas that truly matter.

But what exactly constitutes mundane? Essentially, it refers to techniques or tactics that serve as building blocks rather than innovative strategies. While copying strategy may limit creativity, stealing strategy opens up possibilities for unique innovation.

Therefore, rather than viewing copying as a fallback option, we should see it as a pragmatic tool for facilitating creative success. By copying tactics to establish a foundation, we can then unleash our creative talents to elevate and differentiate our product in meaningful ways.

In core, the key lies in striking a balance between copying and stealing, recognizing when to adopt existing ideas and when to transform them into something entirely new. finaly, It is this thin hair between tradition and innovation that drives the creative wheel.
